# MARIO ADVENTURE

This is a game idea based on MARIO

1)This game uses parallax effects of CSS to move the scenario as MARIO RUN.

2)The object,characters,enemies,and thier sprites are downloaded from t
he internet for practice purposes

3)Keys mapping is used,such as right arrow moves the character front,left arrow moves the 
character backwards,up arrow makes the character jump,down arrow makes the character crouch.

4)Enemy sprites are kept moving at a constant speed and direction.

# Features

1) Rules are as simple as played in MARIO.

2)If MARIO jumps on the enemy, it dies and disappears.If he is touched by the enemy , MARIO loses his life.

3)After losing every life the game gets over.

4)There are some surprise obstacles,which when jumped on ,throws out different surprises which can be bad or good for MARIO.

5)The yellow block in the sky are containers of coins,which when hit,forces the coin to jump out and make the obstacle empty.

6)There are different maps and levels for the user.

    Thats it for now,lets jump into the game.
